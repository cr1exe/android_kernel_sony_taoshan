This is the kernel repo for Xperia L CyanogenMod 11 port maintained by FreeXperiaProject. 

This is not intended for any other device as it is mainly based off the CodeAuroraForum tag LNXLA270291089300 with Sony C2104/C2015 kernel drivers applied on top and approriate changes.

Have fun with it and read the appropriate licence files.

If you're going to reuse our work, which we're doing for free, be fair and give proper credits and you must release your sources.
This is the only payment we're really demanding and we deserve it to be mentioned because of the countless hours we've put into this project.
Open-Source doesn't meant Out-of-Respect!!!


MUCH CREDIT TO VARUN CHITRE FOR HIS CAF WORK WHICH I REBASED RECENTLY FROM (a few drivers and things). (I'll be re-writing it though now)
